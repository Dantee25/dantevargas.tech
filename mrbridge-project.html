                                    The home screen greets users with a welcoming message and provides quick access to key features. One important highlight is the 'low quantity products' section, where users can easily view items that need restocking. The screen also introduces the toolbar, offering seamless navigation to home, inventory, the barcode scanner, and user profile. This toolbar is accessible throughout the entire app, but is first seen here on the home screen.

                    This project successfully improved operational efficiencies and increased user interaction through personalized 
                    features and real-time functionalities. My role involved full-stack development, from database management and 
                    server-side logic to front-end development and user experience design. This project allowed for a seamless transition 
                    for a local physical inventory to an online more secure and accurate inventory.
